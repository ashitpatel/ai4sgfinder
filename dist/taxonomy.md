# AI4SG Allocation Taxonomy

Reference material for the AI4SG Finder assistant. It holds the five allocation archetypes, the decision tree for choosing among them, and deployment examples graded by how well they are verified.

## 1. The five allocation archetypes

| # | Class | Core mathematics | Best-suited problem space | Representative field deployments |
|---|-------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | **Dynamic State Evolution** (Restless Bandits) | Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB), Markov decision processes (MDP), Whittle index policies | Probabilistic behavioral nudges; systems with novelty decay or passive state change over time; volatile environments | ARMMAN mMitra maternal-health call scheduling (India); tuberculosis medication-adherence interventions on 99DOTS data |
| 2 | **Static Demographic Targeting** (Convex Welfare Optimization) | Integer linear programming (ILP), convex optimization, maximin / leximin fairness, welfare metrics | Distribution of irreversible, transactional capital; slow-moving, stable environments; strict legal auditability and democratic transparency | Fair selection of citizens' assemblies (leximin, Sortition Foundation); targeting of cash transfers; siting of schools and water points |
| 3 | **Spatiotemporal Security & Adaptive Search** (Predictive Patrol) | Stackelberg security games, spatial point processes, reinforcement learning (e.g. deep Q-networks) | Allocating mobile patrol assets over physical geography; adversarial or adaptive environments where the target reacts to your moves | PAWS anti-poaching patrol planning (Uganda, Cambodia); ARMOR airport checkpoints (LAX); PROTECT (US Coast Guard) |
| 4 | **Robust Contingency Planning** (Robust / Distributionally Robust Optimization) | Distributionally robust optimization (DRO), stochastic programming, minimax over uncertainty sets | High uncertainty with severe downside (life-or-death outcomes); no historical data or adversarial shocks | Pre-positioning of emergency supplies before hurricanes and floods; vaccine and medicine stockpiling under unknown demand |
| 5 | **Strategic Matching Markets** (Two-Sided Market Design) | Deferred acceptance (Gale–Shapley), stable matching, exchange mechanisms, network flow | Two-sided systems where individuals on both sides hold their own preferences; a planner who cannot dictate outcomes without respecting local choice | NYC and Boston public school choice; the US medical residency match (NRMP); kidney paired-donation exchange; Feeding America's food-bank "Choice System" |

## 2. The NGO decision tree

Filter the field reality through these questions, in order, to isolate the model class.

**Q1. Is the asset capital or a nudge?**
A permanent physical or financial transfer (funds, a well, a building) points to **Static Convex Welfare (Class 2)**. A recurring, probabilistic behavioral routine (remedial hours, wellness check-ins, reminder calls) points to **Dynamic RMABs (Class 1)**.

**Q2. Do recipients (and providers) hold preferences the planner must respect?**
If both sides choose — students and schools, donors and hospitals, volunteers and shifts — and a central assignment would be refused, gamed, or illegitimate, use **Strategic Matching Markets (Class 5)**.

**Q3. Is the environment cooperative, passive, or adversarial?**
If the target environment does not react defensively, a passive Markov model handles it. If the target actively evades your resource (poachers, illegal loggers, adapting disease vectors), overlay **Game-Theoretic Spatiotemporal Search (Class 3)**.

**Q4. What is the penalty for being wrong?**
If a wrong allocation means a classroom stays flat for a week, you can afford to explore (Class 1). If it means a displaced community goes without food during a flood because blankets went to the wrong valley, use **Distributionally Robust Optimization (Class 4)** to protect against worst-case data and shocks. Class 4 is often a layer on top of Class 2 or 3 rather than a replacement.

**Q5. Can the field produce the data the model needs?**
Class 1 needs repeated observations of each recipient (weekly or better). Class 3 needs incident or patrol logs with locations. Class 2 can run from a one-off census or survey. If data cannot be collected at the needed rate, choose a simpler class or no optimization at all, and say so.

### Unverified claims (do not cite without confirmation)

The original draft of this taxonomy included the examples below. They could not be confirmed against a primary source. The assistant must not present them as documented facts; if mentioned at all, label them *"(unverified — please confirm before citing)"*.

- **Mantra4Change** using RMABs to rotate physical student toolkits across school sections.
- **"Prof. Roshni Sahu / Data Science for Social Good"** and ILP-targeted cash transfers for extreme poverty. No such researcher could be confirmed; the Data Science for Social Good fellowship is real, but this attribution is not.
- **UN-OCHA** running DRO for monsoon pre-positioning. Humanitarian pre-positioning is well studied (see Class 4 above), but an OCHA DRO deployment is not confirmed.
- **"Prof. Lily Xu / Harvard Center for Health"** as the lead on tuberculosis adherence calls. Lily Xu is a co-author on related restless-bandit work, but she is best known for PAWS and green-security patrol planning. The TB and maternal-health RMAB deployments are led by Aditya Mate, Jackson Killian, and colleagues in Milind Tambe's Teamcore group.
- **Deceased-donor organ allocation** as stable matching. National organ registries generally allocate deceased-donor organs by priority rules, not a two-sided stable match. Kidney *paired exchange* is the matching-market example.
